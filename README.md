### Project title

HighVintage (help me come up with a better one)

### What and why?

Make thrifting easier and even cooler! 

I've been personally really into thrifting, but at the same time always struggle to find stores of my liking and to come up with outfit ideas. Moreover, I discovered not every thrift/vintage spots appear on the map. 

A full-stack web application HighVintage aims to provide an online space that nurtures a sound thrift community where people can share their thrifted items and styles, recommend stores, and freely talk / ask questions about anything related to thrifting, etc..

Most existing apps serve as amazing platforms that allow users to shop and/or sell their second-hand/vintage items. Yet, the ultimate goal of HighVintage is to build a community so we can help each other make best thrifting experience. As the community grows, we wish thrifting to be recognized as a more accessible way of shopping so more people can make environmentally healthy choices while elevating their wardrobes.

### For whom?

Anyone who... 
- is interested in thrifting
- wants authentic recommendations on thrift stores (could be classified by styles, price, etc.)
- wants to connect with people to share ideas/thoughts on thrifting
- wants cool thrift fashion inspiration

### How?

Some ideas...
1. users can post their thrifted outfits (via images, text, maybe video like IG feed)
2. users can tag stores in their posts + leave comment or select styles that best represent the store (if any) 
3. tagged store could possibly direct users to Google Maps
4. if the store is non-existent on the map, user can add as a new one.
5. users can post any questions or start conversation on specific topics related to thrifting
6. users have their own profiles and can connect + chat with others

### Scope

HighVintage is not too easy for 4 programmers to build considering UI/UX design, frontend, and backend aspects of the project. Features such as posting, user profile, locating store on Google Maps should take some time to develop. Not too sure how complex the project would be, yet I think it is doable for max 6 programmers to complete up to Idea 5. 6 could be challenging depending on the time and required technical skills.
